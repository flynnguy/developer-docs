********

This video demonstrates the various gestures that are available on the Ninja Sphere.

The gestures shown are:

* Hover - Put your hand over the top of the Sphere (close, but without touching it)
* Tap - Using four fingers, tap the top of the Sphere lightly.
* Swipe - Put your hand over the Sphere on one side, then with a flicking motion, move your hand to the other side (like you're swatting away a fly)
* Airwheel - Point your index finger down, and touching the top of the Sphere lightly, draw a circle, like you're dialing a rotary phone. This may take some practice but will get easier over time.

Remember, practice makes perfect! The swipe and airwheel gestures take some getting used to, but you'll get the hang of them.
