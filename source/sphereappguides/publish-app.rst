Publish Application
===================

We are working hard to determine the best way for users to find your applications.

Expect more information in the future as we finalize the product and look to leverage `Snappy Ubuntu <http://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/>`_ and `WebDM <http://www.ubuntu.com/things>`_.

An alternative has been created by `Grayda <https://discuss.ninjablocks.com/t/alpha-sphere-installer-easily-install-drivers-on-your-sphere/3674>`_. The source is available `on github <https://github.com/Grayda/sphere-installer/>`_.
