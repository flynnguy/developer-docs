Technologies used
*****************

Linux
=====
Linux is the underlying operating system for Ninja Sphere. There are many different tutorials on how to use linux. You should have at least a basic familiarity on how to navigate the filesystem and copy files.

Go Lang
=======
Applications and drivers are mostly coded in `Go <https://golang.org/>`_. If you are unfamiliar with it, `A Tour of Go <https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1>`_ is a good place to start.  Even if you are somewhat familiar with Go, it may be useful to read `Channels in Go <http://golangtutorials.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/channels-in-go.html>`_ and `Structs <https://gobyexample.com/structs>`_. 

Git/Github
==========
The main version control system used is `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and you will find a lot of the source code on `github <https://github.com/>`_. 

Mercurial
=========
`Mercurial <https://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ is also used to a lesser extent.

MQTT
====
MQTT is a broker that handles publishing and subscribing for events. Read more in the :doc:`MQTT Section<mqtt>`.

Node.js
=======
`Node <https://nodejs.org/>`_ is mostly no longer used but you may run across it.

Docker
======
You can use `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ to create a local development environment to mimic a sphere. If using docker on a mac, you will also need `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ and `boot2docker <https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/>`_.

Instructions for setting this up and using it can be found in the :doc:`Setting up a Development environment section <setting-up>`.
